# Alexander.ai

## Inspiration

Throughout history, access to knowledge has been both a tool for empowerment and a target for control. The Library of Alexandria aimed to gather and protect the world’s knowledge but was ultimately destroyed, showing how fragile centralized repositories can be. Today, censorship, data centralization, and geopolitical barriers still limit access to information. Alexander.ai aims to tackle these challenges by building a platform that ensures global, unrestricted access to knowledge—decentralized and permanent.

## What It Does

Alexander.ai is a decentralized library designed to:

Search: Let users find any text, book, or article from a global collection.

Retrieve: Access texts stored on a distributed system (IPFS).

Interact: Use a cutting-edge LLM to ask questions and get insights about retrieved text.

Contribute: Empower people to upload books, articles, or other texts, making them part of a permanent, global knowledge hub.

## How I Built It

Blockchain: Utilized STARKNET to provide secure, decentralized metadata and access management.

Distributed Storage: Implemented InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to ensure texts are stored reliably and can’t be tampered with.

Smart Contracts: Created contracts to manage ownership and access rights, ensuring fair use for contributors and users, using Starknet.js for seamless integration.

## Tech Stack:

Backend: Python 3 with Flask for API and server functionality.

Frontend: HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly experience.

LLM Integration: Leveraged LLaMA for advanced natural language querying, with Chroma for better indexing.

Blockchain Tools: Starknet.js for blockchain functionalities.

## Challenges I Ran Into

Scalability: Building a decentralized system that could handle contributions and searches from around the world wasn’t easy.

Blockchain Integration: Setting up STARKNET and optimizing smart contracts took significant effort.

LLM Tuning: Fine-tuning the LLM to work well for diverse languages and complex queries was a challenge.

IPFS Setup: Ensuring consistent file distribution with synchronized metadata posed unique challenges.

Accomplishments That I'm Proud Of

Creating a decentralized library inspired by the vision of universal knowledge sharing.

Successfully integrating STARKNET blockchain and IPFS for secure storage and access.

Building a great UI where users can interact with an LLM to explore texts.

## What I Learned

Advanced blockchain development using STARKNET.

Setting up IPFS for distributed file storage and ensuring reliability.

Fine-tuning LLMs for real-world applications, such as searching and querying texts.

That even small typos in code can sometimes take hours to debug!

## What's Next for Alexander.ai

Accessibility: Expanding multilingual capabilities to include more languages.

Rewards: Introducing a token system to incentivize contributions.

Better Search: Adding features like semantic search and voice-based queries.

Mobile App: Developing an app so people can access the library anywhere.

Community Governance: Allowing users to vote on content moderation and platform updates.

Alexander.ai is just the beginning of a movement toward a fairer, more accessible world of knowledge.
